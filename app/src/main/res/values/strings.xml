    <string name="instructionsForOtc" translatable="false">Welcome to Otc Medicines application.

The purpose of the app is to help pharmacists, doctors and patients for finding the price of Over The Counter medicine after government has set free the price.

At the beginning all prices are calculated with 35% margin.

At first screen you  see all the OTC medicines that exist in Greece. You are informed about the image, the name and the price. Scrolling down you can informed about the whole database. At the top of the screen there is a search questionmark where tapping on you can search for a specific medicine. After tapping a search bar comes alive and there you can type. You can search either by writing letters or numbers which refer to name and price of medicine
While typing for searching the list of the medicines shortens.
You can swipe left or right to delete a medicine if you don’t want to have it inside the list. If you make a mistake you can refer to the below paragraph where there is an explanation how you can fetch a new and updated database from internet.

If you want to change the margin profit of the medicine you tap on the menu and you select “Settings”. In the next screen you select a margin profit from 0 to 99 and going back to main screen all prices are calculated again!

The application gives the opportunity by selecting “Download Database” from menu to download the most recent database from internet so you have the latest prices given by the pharmaceutical companies. This function is also available if someone erases from the database a medicine and wants to get it back. The app will never miss new prices as inside it there is a function to download new database independently and every one week approximately.

By selecting a medicine you are transferred to a new screen where there is all info about the medicine. You can see an enlarged image and you can read all info. In addition by tapping the share button you can send these info to a friend by passing an internet link

Feel free to send comments and suggestions at the e-mail: soloupis@gmail.com
